# Volley Architecture notes and committments
  
  
 ### Volley Differentiators
 * Personalization
   * The 5 right resources for you, not 1.2bn "matching" ones
   * Collaborative filtering and tagging of resources
 * Adaptability (of style of delivery) -  improves as you use it / give feedback
 * Presentation
   * microlearning (e.g. excerpt right 3 min from 20 min video)
   * mobile-first, gamification, learning-driven content
 * Verifiability
   * Analytics, BI 
   * Assessments
 * Pedagogy
 * auto-generated content
 
 
 ### Volley Product Commitments
 * Volley is a primary learning resource for professional training
 * Volley is mobile first (Master Interface is not a mobile interface)
 * The future of assessments is automatic quiz generation
 * Volley's improvements over usual microcourses are: personalization, form factor, auto-generated content (inexpensive) incorporating pedagogy, quiz driven recommendations
 * Volley's improvement over search is smart search (search over related terms, soon graph powered)
 * Volley's technology is subject matter agnostic



### Off-track
* Enterprises spend huge $ attracting and retaining the right people.  Can our assessments help employers determine what knowledge makes a successful employee? Can this help produce actually-relevant job ads that characterize the needed qualities for a job?
* Experts on demand
* Using our data on alternative resource composition / learning pathways to find "the best under xyz conditions"
